Approaching XR as a traditional Unity game developer, I was getting tired of switching between different plugins and workflows in the rapidly changing XR world. WebXR seemed like an interesting way out of this, and what better way to learn a new technology than participating in hackathons? [Steampunk Digital][steampunk] organized a series of XR hackathons / challenges between February and July, 2022. I participated in all of them and created three different experiences within short timeframes! A big shoutout to [PlayCanvas][playcanvas] which made this possible! You can find details of the entries in the corresponding blog posts.
