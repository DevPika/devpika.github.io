Developed during the Computer Vision course under the guidance of Dr. Pritee Khanna at IVE Lab, IIITDMJ, this research project uses state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms like Mask RCNN for automatic segmentation of smoke regions in images.

Technologies used: Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Python, Google Colab
