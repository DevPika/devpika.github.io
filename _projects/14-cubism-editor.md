I created a simple puzzle editor for [Cubism VR][game] in Unity! Using this, you can create custom levels for the game, which are saved in the JSON format expected by the game. Thanks to the creator of the game, Thomas Van Bouwel, for the special mention on the official modding repository for Cubism on GitHub!

Find more instructions and the entire source code on the [project's GitHub repo][repo]!
