I love playing games. But even more than that, I love to try out new games and analyze what makes playing them enjoyable or frustrating. I have been involved with the game development group at my undergraduate institute (IIITDM Jabalpur) right from its inception. During these four years, I have participated in numerous game jams ([even in Ludum Dare!][ludumdare]), conducted a workshop on game development in Unity, moderated many interesting discussions around game design and helped in curation of online gamedev resources (like Extra Credits and GDC Talks). I also regularly play video and board games (using Tabletop Simulator) online with my friends. Ping me if this sounds interesting! :-D
