Tools and libraries like [three.js](https://threejs.org/), [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/) and [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/) have made my journey exploring WebXR for prototyping interactions possible. In addition to being quite powerful, rivalling even native VR development options, these libraries are open-source! My recent explorations using them have renewed my appreciation for open-source software, as it is not just about the code out in the open, but also the strong community of contributors and collaborators that form around them. I try to consciously open-source most demos, examples and personal projects I work on as my way of giving back to this community. VR/AR APIs change rapidly, so most things I was able to learn while working in this domain was by reading others' code. I hope through open-sourcing my code, I inspire people to try out WebXY and quicken its adoption even by a bit. This also encourages me to write better code and document my process clearly.

Then there is the occasional chance when one happens upon a bug/feature while working with open-source. Logging such instances on the project's issue tracker/discussion board either as a new post or adding to existing discsusions in one of the first steps (after ascertaining this is indeed a bug/feature of course ;D). But if all the stars align and you have the knowledge and opportunity to contribute, then why not go ahead?

Such were my thoughts as I found a bug while working on a three.js demo about attaching objects to tracked hands inside AR/VR. [A quick fix and one merged MR later](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/24827), my demo worked perfectly! I learned quite a bit through the process, as each open-source community/project has its own intricacies when it comes to contributions. With this experience under my belt, I feel more ready to be part of the three.js community and WebXR codebases in general.

Going back quite a bit, my first experience with open-source contribution was with the wonderful library for conducting (VR) experiments in Unity, [UXF](https://github.com/immersivecognition/unity-experiment-framework). In this case, it wasn't a bug but some features I wanted to see (discussed [here](https://github.com/immersivecognition/unity-experiment-framework/pull/21) and [here](https://github.com/immersivecognition/unity-experiment-framework/pull/22)) in the library. The maintainer gave me quick feedback which made my experience really smooth.

I hope I have many more opportunities to contribute to any open-source efforts!
