I participated in the OzCHI 2019 Student Design Challenge as part of Team Outeraction. We came up with a system to build and maintain social capital during adverse events, with specific consideration of Mumbai floods. We had a whole of 24 hours to develop the brainstorm on the provided brief and present our solution with a short video, paper and blog showing our process. I took up the responsibility of writing the paper. It was a great learning experience!
