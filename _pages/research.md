**Update (Feb 2020):** Paper on tactile feedback published in **ACM TEI 2020**, WIP track

My research interests mainly lie in the areas of Natural and Tangible User Interfaces, 3D User Interfaces (3DUI) and Virtual Reality. In all of my recent work, the underlying motivation is to create seamless interactions between humans and computers. Here I list some work that has helped me gain research exposure.

### Research at [Embedded Interaction Lab](http://embeddedinteractions.com/), IIT Guwahati (May – Nov 2019)
Six-month research internship under Dr. Keyur Sorathia’s guidance. My primary role in the lab was to aid in the development of virtual environments for user studies and contribute as an HCI researcher. The two projects I worked on:
* Comparison of different types of feedbacks for a bespoke tactile controller for non-visual exploration of virtual space.
  * Publication: Pranjal Protim Borah, **Ayaskant Panigrahi**, and Keyur Sorathia. 2020. TMOVE: Multimodal Feedback Actuator for Non-visual Exploration of Virtual Lines. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI ’20). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 603–610. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3374920.3374994.

* Comparison of different gesture based selection methods for immersive virtual environments. Developed Unity3D application (with C# scripting) to prototype and test various free hand gesture based selection techniques.
  * Publication: Bhowmick, S., **Panigrahi, A.**, Sorathia K. Comparative Study of Point and Tap User-Centered Gesture for Object Selection at Arm’s Length in Highly Dense Environments. Manuscript to be submitted.

### OzCHI 24-hr Student Design/Research Challenge (Aug 2019)
[My team, Team Outeraction](/projects/ozchi-sdc/), featured in the top five amongst all participating teams worldwide in [OzCHI SDC'19](http://ozchi2019.visemex.org/wp/participate/ozchi-student-design-challenge-sdc/) as part of the *31st Australian Conference on Human-Computer-Interaction (OzCHI'19)*.

### As part of coursework:
* Implementation of research paper titled ["Parameter-Free Selective Segmentation With Convex Variational Methods"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8550655) using OpenCV and Python as part of Image Processing course
* Implementation of research paper titled ["A Fast Implementation of Deflate"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6824430) using C and standard compression libraries like zlibc and lz4 as part of Design and Analysis of Algorithms course
