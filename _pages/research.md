My research interests mainly lie in the areas of Natural and Tangible User Interfaces, 3D User Interfaces (3DUI) and Virtual Reality. In all of my recent work, the underlying motivation is to create seemless interactions between humans and computers. Here I list some work that has helped me gain research exposure.

* **Update (13 Nov 2019):** Tactile non visual exploration of virtual space, **accepted for ACM TEI 2020**, WIP track
* [WIP] Controller-less selection of objects in VR HMD setting, to be submitted for IEEE VR 2020, full paper track

### As part of coursework:
* Implementation of research paper titled ["Parameter-Free Selective Segmentation With Convex Variational Methods"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8550655) using OpenCV and Python as part of Image Processing course
* Implementation of research paper titled ["A Fast Implementation of Deflate"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6824430) using C and standard compression libraries like zlibc and lz4 as part of Design and Analysis of Algorithms course
