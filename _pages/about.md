I am a graduate student pursuing MSc. in Interactive Arts & Technology at Simon Fraser Univeristy, Canada. I am a member of the [VVISE research lab][vvise] directed by Prof. Wolfgang Stuerzlinger. I am always on the lookout for innovative ways of interacting with computers and their applications in various fields.

My research interests mainly lie in the areas of Natural and Tangible User Interfaces, 3D User Interfaces (3DUI) and Virtual Reality. The underlying motivation in my work is to create seamless interactions between humans and computers. Read more about my research [here](/research/).

I was a part of the [game design and development group][gamedev] at my undergraduate institute, participating in and organizing events like gamejams and Unity workshops over the past few years. When not working on cool projects, you can find me reading up about awesome HCI projects, helping out my institute's clubs with branding or playing table tennis.

Follow me on [GitHub][gh], [Behance][be] or visit this site frequently to keep track of my latest projects!

You can find my CV [here][cv].
