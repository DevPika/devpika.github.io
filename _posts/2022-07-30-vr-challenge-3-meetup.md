In-person meetup with the VanVR group in Vancouver
<!--more-->

Thanks to the organizers Aaron (from Steampunk Digital) and Nick (from Hammer and Tong), I was able to meet with many people working in the VR domain! My submission DAW[n]XR was announced as the winner of the last challenge :-D I got a lot of useful feedback from everyone who tried my experience. Also a shoutout to [Michela Ledwidge from MOD](https://michelaledwidge.com/) for the great talk! I look forward to meeting them again at SIGGRAPH in a few weeks!
