Badge for completing programming exercises in 12 different languages throughout 2023
<!--more-->

I was able to complete atleast 5 exercises in 12 different (types of) programming languages throughout 2023! Exercism was running [the #12in23 challenge](https://exercism.org/challenges/12in23), where each month they set specific kinds of languages and exercises as themes for each month. For example, in Functional February, I got to explore functional paradigms using F#. While I wasn't able to complete each theme in the specific months, I did a bit of a programming sprint during the winter holidays after my grad defense. My perseverance paid off and I was able to obtain [the "Legendary" #12in23 badge](https://exercism.org/profiles/DevPika/badges)!

It was a fun learning experience, made more interesting by the in-depth videos every month for the specific themes. They even featured interviews with the creators(!) of the languages, from which I got to learn some of the thinking that goes into designing programming languages.
