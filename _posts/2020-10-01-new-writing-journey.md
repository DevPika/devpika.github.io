This is the first in a series of articles that I plan to write over the next few months.

Why blog, you ask? Well, I believe blogging is an excellent way to keep track of progress and keep oneself accountable. It can also urge the author to critically and actively engage with the covered content instead of becoming a passive consumer of information. Plus writing about tech is fun! So, I am going to try covering the interesting and fast-changing world of Human-Computer Interaction, both from an industrial and an academic perspective. Much of this will come from distilling news articles, research papers and online learning material, so I will link to the sources whenever possible. I am also planning a special weekend coverage of news from the Extended Reality world (similar to a newsletter), including discussion on innovative products in the market and game releases. So stay tuned!
