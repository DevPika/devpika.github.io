Using Jekyll and Bulma to carry out a long due redesign
<!--more-->

It had been a long time since I had a chance to redesign my website, so I dove straight in. While the design is pretty simple, I created a few sketches using Indesign Studio, followed by a lot of cutomization of the [Bulma Clean Theme Gem](https://github.com/chrisrhymes/bulma-clean-theme) for Jekyll. I used the base colors and layout of the [Darkly theme](https://jenil.github.io/bulmaswatch/darkly/) for Bulma too! I hope this has made my website more polished looking and readable!
