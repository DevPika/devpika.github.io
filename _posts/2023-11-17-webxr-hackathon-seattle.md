Micheal, Rahul, Daniel and I came together to form the Reality Rebels team at the Meta + AWS Hackathon in Seattle this week. Tear your room's walls apart with a portal & shoot targets reminiscent of Zelda BotW! We used [threlte](https://threlte.xyz/) (threejs + Svelte) to create the experience. A big shoutout to [Micheal Parks](https://parks.lol/) for his great work integrating and maintaing the [XR package for threlte](https://threlte.xyz/docs/reference/xr/getting-started), which was the base for our project! He also came up with a cool soundtrack for our game, all within the hackathon timeline! While the original vision of the game included multiplayer aspects using WebRTC (which we partially got working), I had lots of fun regardless! I also got to meet with lots of talented people and learn about their experience working with WebXR and MR tech!
