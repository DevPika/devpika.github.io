My thesis focuses on on-arm UI inside VR and passthrough AR.
<!--more-->

I successfully presented and defended my MSc. thesis on a novel on-arm UI system control technique for VR and passthrough AR from the School of Interactive Arts and Technology, SFU. Very interesting questions and discussions looking towards the future. This is my small contribution to bring futuristic UI into reality! I consider this an early Christmas gift :-D
