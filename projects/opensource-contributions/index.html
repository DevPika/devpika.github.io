            <p>Tools and libraries like <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>, <a href="https://www.babylonjs.com/">BabylonJS</a> and <a href="https://playcanvas.com/">PlayCanvas</a> have made my journey exploring WebXR for prototyping interactions possible. In addition to being quite powerful, rivalling even native VR development options, these libraries are open-source! My recent explorations using them have renewed my appreciation for open-source software, as it is not just about the code out in the open, but also the strong community of contributors and collaborators that form around them. I try to consciously open-source most demos, examples and personal projects I work on as my way of giving back to this community. VR/AR APIs change rapidly, so most things I was able to learn while working in this domain was by reading others’ code. I hope through open-sourcing my code, I inspire people to try out WebXR and quicken its adoption even by a bit. This also encourages me to write better code and document my process clearly.</p>

<p>Then there is the occasional chance when one happens upon a bug/feature while working with open-source. Logging such instances on the project’s issue tracker/discussion board either as a new post or adding to existing discsusions in one of the first steps (after ascertaining this is indeed a bug/feature of course ;D). But if all the stars align and you have the knowledge and opportunity to contribute, then why not go ahead?</p>

<p>Such were my thoughts as I found a bug while working on a three.js demo about attaching objects to tracked hands inside AR/VR. <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/24827">A quick fix and one merged MR later</a>, my demo worked perfectly! I learned quite a bit through the process, as each open-source community/project has its own intricacies when it comes to contributions. With this experience under my belt, I feel more ready to be part of the three.js community and WebXR codebases in general.</p>

<p>I have also contributed <a href="https://github.com/Igalia/wolvic/pull/391">a dev feature for testing web extensions</a> to the Wolvic repository. Wolvic is an open-source browser for XR devices based on the Firefox Reality codebase, and this feature released in <a href="https://wolvic.com/blog/release_1.3/">v1.3</a> made Wolvic the first XR browser to have experimental support for installing web extensions locally through a downloaded file. Previously, a user could only install specific extensions from the Firefox Add-on store that had been marked as working with XR. For any other extension though, the browser would simply download the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.xpi</code> file but there was no way of installing it. I got my feet wet with the repo by first <a href="https://github.com/Igalia/wolvic/pull/389">fixing</a> a smaller build related <a href="https://github.com/Igalia/wolvic/issues/283">issue marked as a “good first issue”</a> before attempting to add the extension installation feature. Understanding the layout of a large browser project and singling out a specific part to work on was immensely satisfying for me. I was able to get a nice workflow going for local extension installation within a few days, including integration with exisiting UI dialogs, thanks to the prompt and detailed feedback from Sergio @ Wolvic!</p>

<p>I also ran across a bug while experimenting with WebXR and the WASM integration for Faust (Functional Audio Stream), a functional programming language for sound synthesis and audio processing. While mapping the pitchbend WebMIDI control to a Faust synth instrument, I realized the MIDI signals were not getting sent correctly to the WASM core because of a bug in the wrapper code. <a href="https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/pull/909">A quick fix later</a>, I was able to map various attributes of a Flute synth DSP like pitch and breath control to the position of a VR controller and the trigger axis respectively! The fact I could get such a demo working shows that a modern day browser environment provides endless opportunities for innovation and experimentation!</p>

<p>It isn’t always about fixing bugs, as sometimes even slightly better help and documentation can make someone’s day! I am a big fan of the <a href="https://exercism.org/">Exercism</a> website and community, especially their <a href="https://exercism.org/challenges/12in23">#12in23 challenge</a> to learn and solve challenges in 12 languages within 2023. Each month has a dedicated theme which inspires me to explore different languages and programming paradigms. They also have discussions with creators and maintainers of languages for each month! I was happy to <a href="https://github.com/exercism/clojure/pull/563">contribute back</a> to this community by adding some documentation to <a href="https://exercism.org/tracks/clojure/exercises/cars-assemble">one of their exercises</a> in the Clojure track.</p>

<p>Going back quite a bit, my first experience with open-source contribution was with the wonderful library for conducting (VR) experiments in Unity, <a href="https://github.com/immersivecognition/unity-experiment-framework">UXF</a>. In this case, it wasn’t a bug but some features I wanted to see (discussed <a href="https://github.com/immersivecognition/unity-experiment-framework/pull/21">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/immersivecognition/unity-experiment-framework/pull/22">here</a>) in the library. The maintainer gave me quick feedback which made my experience really smooth.</p>

<p>I hope I have many more opportunities to contribute to any open-source efforts!</p>
